% cutasdf = ASDFchoosetime(asdf, startTime, endTime)
%
%    asdf - {nNeu+2,1} ASDF to subsample from
%    startTime - (scalar) Starting time of new asdf
%                  if only two arguments are given, this is the time that you wanna choose.
%    endTime - (scalar) Ending time of new asdf
%    
%
% Returns:
%    cutasdf - {nNeu+2,1} ASDF with new time and duration
