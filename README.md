# NeuroFppToolbox
MATLAB toolbox to automatically detect, analyze and visualize spatiotemporal fractional propagating patterns in neural population activity, developed by Dr. Pulin Gong's group at University of Sydney. This toolbox includes the generation of a spiking neural network, and the analysis of the simulated data and the experimental data. 

If you use our code in your research, please cite us as follows:

## Network generation
A spiking neural circuit simulation model edited by Yifan Gu, Yuxi Liu, James Henderson, Guozhang Chen. The instruction is detailed in the readme file in the sub-folder.


## Simulation data analysis


## Experimental data analysis
The detection, analysis and visualization of the fractional propagating patterns in the experimental data can be found in the main function Project1.m in the sub-folder experimental_data_analysis/Toolbox_CSC. An example movie of the experimental data can be found in the sub-folder example movies. The full data can be shared upon requested. The code to generate the figure 2 and figure 3 in the paper "Lévy walk dynamics explain gamma burst patterns in primate cerebral cortex" can be found in the sub-folder experimental_data_analysis/Toolbox_CSC/p1.
