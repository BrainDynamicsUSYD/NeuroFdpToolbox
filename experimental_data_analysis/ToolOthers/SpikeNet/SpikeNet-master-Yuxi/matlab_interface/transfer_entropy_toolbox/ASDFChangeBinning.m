% new_asdf = ASDFChangeBinning(asdf, factor)
%    asdf - {n_neu,n_bin} the old asdf binned with different bin size
%    factor - (1,1) the number of bins that you want to consider as one bin
%                   in the new asdf. must be an integer.
%
% Returns:
%    new_asdf - {n_neu,n_bin_new} the new asdf binned with different bin size
%
% Description :
%    Change binning size. New asdf will have the size n_bin_new = floor(n_bin / factor)
%    Since it "bins" the spiking, the resulting timing becomes an integer (and unique).
