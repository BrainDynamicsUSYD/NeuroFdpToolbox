1. Preparation
==============
Compile the mex file (C program) with gcc or lcc (Matlab default C compiler).
>> mex transent.c % if you use mex for the first time, you might be prompted to choose a compiler.
Put all the programs into your Matlab path (or current directory).
That's it!
For demonstration of the code, please download Izhik_100_0.mat from our
project web page, open and run 'simple_demo.m'.


2. Another Spiking Data Format (ASDF)
=====================================
Another Spike Data Format is basically cell array of spike timing of each neuron.
In order to calculate TE correctly, I recommend to use only integer for the timing.
To ensure that, you can do
>> asdf = ChangeBinning(asdf, 1);

Last two cells contains special information of the data.

asdf{end-1}: Binning size in unit of ms (milisecond). (e.g. 1.2 -> 1.2ms/bin, 10 -> 10ms/bin etc...)
asdf{end}: Array of number of neurons, number of total bins of the data
  (e.g. [10 300000] -> 10 neurons, 300000 time bins)


3. Functions (Please refer to help of each function for details)
================================================================
* TE Calculation
ASDFTE.m: (requires transentmex) delayed higher order TE calculator for ASDF.
ASDFTE_parallel.m: (requires transentmex, and Parallel Computing Toolbox)
Parallel version of ASDFTE.m. Call 'matlabpool(N)' before running.

* Changing Data Format
SparseToASDF.m: Convert matrix form of raster to ASDF.
ASDFToSparse.m: Convert ASDF to sparse matrix of size (nNeu, duration)

* ASDF utilities
ASDFSubsample.m: Subsample specified neurons from ASDF.
ASDFChooseTime.m: Crop a time segment from larger ASDF.
ASDFGetfrate.m: Get firing rate (per bin) of all the neurons.
ASDFChangeBinning.m: Change binning size of ASDF.

* Supporting functions (not to be excuted directly)
transent.c: Mex file for rapid calculation of TE.


4. About the order and delay of TE
==================================
Order is 'length of time you include in the past'.
If you use 3rd order, you include 3 bins before the time you want to predict.

* - the time bin you want to predict
o - the time bin you use for prediction
1st order
train i:   ....o*....
train j:   ....o.....

3rd order for both i and j
train i:   ..ooo*....
train j:   ..ooo.....

Delay is 'distance of time from what you want to predict to what you use for predict'.

delay=1 (1st order)
train i:   ....o*....
train j:   ....o.....

delay=3 (1st order)
train i:   ....o*....
train j:   ..o.......

You can also combine these two.

delay=3 (2nd order for j, 3rd order for i)
train i:   ..ooo*....
train j:   .oo.......
