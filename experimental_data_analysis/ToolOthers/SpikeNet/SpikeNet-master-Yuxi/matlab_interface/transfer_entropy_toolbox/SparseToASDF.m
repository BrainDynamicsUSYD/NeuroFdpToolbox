% asdf = SparseToASDF(raster, binunit)
%
%    raster - (n_neu, duration) (Sparse) time raster expressed as a sparse matrix.
%    binunit - (scalar, double) the unit of time in the data in ms. (length of a bin in real scale)
%
% Returns:
%    asdf - {n_neu + 2, 1} ASDF version of the data
%
% Description :
%    This function converts sparse matrix version of the data to ASDF version.
