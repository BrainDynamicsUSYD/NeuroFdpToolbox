% [te_result, ci_result, all_te] = ASDFTE(asdf, j_delay, i_order, j_order, windowsize)
% Parameters:
%   asdf        - Time series in Another Spike Data Format (ASDF)
%   j_delay     - Number of bins to lag sender (j series) or a vector [default 1]
%   i_order     - Order of receiver [default 1]
%   j_order     - Order of sender [default 1]
%   windowsize  - window size used for Coincidence Index calculation (odd number only)
%
% Returns:
%   te_result - (nNeu, nNeu) NxN matrix where N(i, j) is the transfer entropy from i->j
%               If multiple j_delay is given, this is a peak value of TE over delay.
%   ci_result - (nNeu, nNeu) NxN matrix where N(i, j) is the Coincidence Index from i->j
%               Multiple delays are necessary to calculate it.
%   all_te    - (nNeu, nNeu, delays) NxNxd matrix where N(i, j, k) is the transfer entropy
%               from i->j at delay of jdelay(k). For those who need all the delays.
%
% Examples:
% >> te = ASDFTE(asdf); % gives you delay 1 TE.
% >> [maxte, ci] = ASDFTE(asdf, 1:30); % gives you TEPk and TECI based on delay of 1 to 30.
% >> [maxte, ci] = ASDFTE(asdf, 1:30, 2, 3); % gives you HOTEPk and HOTECI (k=2, l=3) based on delay of 1 to 30.
% >> [maxte, ci, te] = ASDFTE(asdf, 1:30, 1, 1, 3); % gives you TEPk and TECI with CI window of 3, also gives you TE at all delays.
